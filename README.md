# SQLite-restaurant-database
In this project, I've built a comprehensive database system for a restaurant business. The database is constructed around six interrelated tables: Customer, Menu, Ingredient, Rewards, Transactions, and Menu_Ingredients. These tables encompass various aspects of the restaurant operation, from detailing customer information, storing a catalog of menu items and their ingredients, tracking customer rewards, to recording transactional data.

I've diligently designed queries, leveraging SQL features such as JOINs to collate data from multiple tables. This process provides holistic views that are integral for business insights. Moreover, I've utilized aggregate functions to derive valuable statistical data such as average pricing or total quantity sold.

To address more complex queries, I've employed advanced SQL techniques like subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs), enabling multi-layered data analysis. This has proven essential in scenarios like calculating the average price of menu items using specific ingredients.

In conclusion, this project has been a fulfilling journey towards deepening my SQL proficiency. It's given me practical experience in building a multi-faceted relational database system and navigating it using advanced SQL queries for insightful business intelligence.
